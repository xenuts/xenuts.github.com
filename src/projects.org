| [[./img/projects/cnnt-300x183.png]] | We propose a robust online tracking approach for general objects with a convolutional neural network (CNN) based appearance model. To alleviate the problems incurred by immediately using CNN for online tracking task, we presented a re-sampling method over particles with a variation of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to gain better posteriors, and draw a set of more reliable training samples to feed CNN at the same time. |

| [[./img/projects/edt-300x183.png]] | We tackle the generic object tracking problem by a novel approach that incorporates a deep learning architecture with an on-line AdaBoost framework. Inspired by its multi-level feature learning ability, a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) is used to learn multi-level feature descriptors from a set of auxiliary images. |

| [[./img/projects/tennis-300x183.png]] | A two layered data association method to improve the robustness of tennis ball tracking. At the local layer, a shift token transfer method is proposed, based on shift window processing, to generate a set of short trajectories or ``trajectorylets''. At the global layer, a unique ball trajectory is obtained by applying a dynamic programming based splice method to a directed acyclic graph consisting of trajectorylets. |
